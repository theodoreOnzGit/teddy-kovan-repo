# Kovan standard open corpus

Source documents for **Kovan's built-in nuclear-engineering corpus**. Kovan
(part of [OUTRAM PARK](https://github.com/theodoreOnzGit/outram-park-backend))
compiles the metadata of exactly these documents (titles, authors, topics)
into its binary (`crates/kovan/src/corpus.rs`); the PDFs live here so they are
never shipped in the Kovan crate. Only documents in this folder are
hardcoded into Kovan. The owner's other open literature is in
[`../theodore-open-corpus/`](../theodore-open-corpus/).

Every document here is redistributable, on one of two grounds:

1. **U.S. NRC documents: open access, U.S. Government Work.**
2. **Open access under the Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC BY 4.0).**

## 1. U.S. NRC documents

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Site Disclaimer
(<https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/site-disclaimer>, accessed 22 September 2026)
states, verbatim:

> NRC's website constitutes a U.S. Government Work under federal copyright law
> and as such, it is not subject to copyright. It is freely available for
> non-exclusive rights in publication or reproduction for any purpose, in any
> form, and there are no restrictions on use. Similarly, there is no restriction
> on the right of others to use or reproduce the same material, now or in the
> future. NRC would appreciate the courtesy of credit for the publication.
> Permission to reproduce any copyrighted material (including photos or
> graphics) must be obtained from the original source.

The underlying statute is 17 U.S.C. § 105 (no copyright in works of the U.S.
Government). As the NRC asks, each document is credited to the NRC below. The
last sentence of the quotation still applies: any figure or photograph inside a
report that is credited to a third party keeps that party's copyright.

Each document is the NRC's own publication, retrieved from the NRC's ADAMS
public library under its accession number.

**Where to check:** the NRC Site Disclaimer page quoted above
(<https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/site-disclaimer>); it covers every NRC document
in this table. The documents themselves carry no licence statement of their
own.

Laboratory) under NRC sponsorship and published by the NRC in its NUREG series.
They are included on the basis of the NRC statement above, as NRC publications.

Papers from **PHYSOR 2026, The International Conference on Physics of
Reactors** (Torino, Italy, 19–23 April 2026; proceedings ISBN
979-12-81583-46-7), each deposited on Zenodo under **CC BY 4.0**, as recorded
on its Zenodo DOI record (checked 22 September 2026). The PDFs do not restate
the licence; the DOI record is the source for it.

**Where to check:** open each paper's DOI link in the table below; the Zenodo
record page lists the licence. It was checked through Zenodo's API,
`https://zenodo.org/api/records/<record number>`, whose `metadata.license`
field reads `cc-by-4.0` for all four.
